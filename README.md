Computer Science 4 Kids

This project contains the source code for some small programs I wrote several years ago when my daughter was in first grade. At that time, her teacher asked me whether I could train the kids in using computers.

Knowing what the kids were learning at that time, I wrote 3-4 small programs involving what the teacher was teaching them.
